# CMS OpenFX plugin for Natron

This is a collection of plugin I made to :
* Create 3D luts with a set of 2 plugins (CMSPattern and CMSBakeLut)
* Read Magic Lantern MLV files natively (CMSMLVReader)

# Dependencies

* libraw (supplied in the source tree, because it needs specific build)
* Ceres
* Eigen3
* Glog

# Build on Windows

Use standard CMake build and install method with msys2/mingw64

# Build on Linux

I will fix the build system later, but it should be nearly OK
